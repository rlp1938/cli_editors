README for CliEditors
This project is a collection of html editing programs. Generally the
programs are intended to edit html so as to make the files work better
with the program wkhtmltopdf. Static built binaries of wkhtmltopdf are
available at: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
You can also get the progarm from the Ubuntu/Debian repositories but
when I used that version some years ago I found it too brain dead to
bother about.

1. csv2html - takes tabular data in csv format and and generates a html
file of tables as needed to display the csv data. With manual assistance
it takes care of page breaks so that the html is in a form suitable for
wkhtmltopdf to make a PDF suitable for printing. By default it produces
gutter margins suitable for two sided printing.

2. cathtml - takes a command line list html files and concatenates them
into one file, output to stdout. The first html file named provides all
of the data up to the <body> tag. You can redirect the output to a named
output file of course.

3. hexsed - a stream editor that uses data in hex format for the string
to delete or strings to find and replace.

4. csv2anki - takes a CSV file as input and writes a CSV output to
stdout with the ordering of columns changed, deleted and/or combined as
rquired. There is a README in src/Csv2anki/

See the individual README files in src/* where they exist.
