README - for csv2html

The purpose of this program is to generate html with inserted page break
styles so that wkhtmltopdf can generate the pdf sensibly paginated.
Wkhtmltopdf simply page breaks a table with many rows in the middle of
the text within the row. This program takes the csv and under manual
control generates html with one table per page and a forced page break
before each table.

The first required step is to generate a partly completed XML control
file and then edit that control file to optionally name the generated
html file, by default index.html. You may enter table header and/or
table footer data or comment out either or both using C style comments
(/* */).
And then one page at a time enter the number of rows for the table on
that page.

It would be great to have something do this job automatically but though
this program requires manual assistance it still completes a 1500 row
csv file in less than half an hour.

ASSUMPTIONS
The CSV input is required to have comma separated columns and any commas
embedded in the text within column text are required to be protected by
wrapping the comma text inside "". This is the default output from
LibreOffice.
