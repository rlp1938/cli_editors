# The target file has been generated from a pdf file using 'pdftotxt'.
# The pdf file in question contains Thai characters and also
# transliterated Thai using combining chars as tone marks. As output the
# text file contains a UTF-8 string 'e2 80 a8' string which is labeled
# text editor 'geany' as 'LS' which I guess means 'line separator'.
# There is also an object shown as 'FF' which is simply '0c' or ascii FF.

# LS is followed by a normal Unix line feed so the LS may be simply
# deleted as also the FF and I use 'hexsed' for this purpose.
# NB the LS string is not UTF-8 Thai, all Thai UTF-8 begins with 'e0'.

# Text file
fn=wannaporns-65-thai-phrases.txt
# Html file

# Backup of text file - at the outset make this by hand.
