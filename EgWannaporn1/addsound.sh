# The html file comprises paragraphs with lines inside the para split by
# <br />. The are: 1. Thai script, 2. Transliterated tone marked script,
# and 3. The meaning or meanings in English, a line each, And,
# occasionally explanatory English.
# The objective is to add one or more <audio controls> elements at the
# bottom of each paragraph. It's easy to do because each para is
# numbered in sequence at the beginning.
